# NF1

This is the digital twin for the [NF1](https://rotorbuilds.com/build/15163),
the racing quadcopter used in the development of
[Neuroflight](https://github.com/wil3/neuroflight).
All motor parameters were found using the methods described in Wil Koch's [thesis](http://wfk.io/docs/WilliamKochThesisFINAL.pdf) "Flight Controller Synthesis Via Deep Reinforcement Learning".

Quadcopter components have been modelled in Freecad with the exception of the
propeller models which have been obtained and converted to DAE from
https://grabcad.com/library/gemfan-5-propeller-5152r-1. All credit goes to the user persopolo in the design of these awesome propeller models.
